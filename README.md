## üßë‚Äçüîß About the Dotfiles
> [!NOTE]
>  **TL;DR Who cares!?**

I started this project on 8 December 2024 when I got laid off from my previous company. This project helped me fill the gap after getting laid off and continues my journey in **Ricing** Industry, which has been left untouched since 2020. Looking at my previous dotfiles makes me think, **God... What is this mess?** They're so disorganized and nearly impossible to reproduce. So, my comeback here is to create dotfiles with clean and simple code also easy to use.

This configuration is inspired by this cruel world, depression and anxious feeling. Please note that these configuration is simply **what works and looks good to me**, and they may not work for everyone, you have to adjust by yourself if some not work or *different taste* (lol) :laughing:. Feel free to use or adapt anything you find useful. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or problem.

**This configuration is:**
- :cry: Moody, can be dark or light.
- :keyboard: Keyboard users might love it but mouse-friendly too.

## üìö Dependencies (Prerequisite)
This guide will help you to install some essential dependencies in order to used this configuration and running the OS properly.

> [!WARNING]  
> ü§ñ Still tested and running on Void Linux only.<br>
> But I planned to supporting and providing info for any other Linux Distribution, until then if you're not using Void Linux, please research all the dependecies all by yourself üôè

Anyway... You know how to install dependencies in Void Linux?
```bash
sudo xbps-install abc1 abc2 abc3 ...
```

<details>
<summary><b>Core dependencies (Void Linux)</b></summary>

#### Core utilities
```
git curl wget unzip
```

#### Core dependencies (in order to work properly)
> **Notes**: If you're previously using `wpa_supplicant` or any other network manager, please disable service or it will be conflict between services. We'll use `NetworkManager` service to connect to internet and for widget we'll use `nm-applet`.
```
xorg base-devel brightnessctl dbus NetworkManager network-manager-applet dunst tlp wlogout
```
For rootless `brightnessctl` you can use bellow command.
```bash
sudo chmod +s $(which brightnessctl)
```
Enable all services
```
sudo ln -s
```
**Context**: [XOrg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg), [D-Bus](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/session-management.html#d-bus), [base-devel](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1720288#p1720288), [TLP](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/power-management.html), [Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst), [wlogout](https://github.com/ArtsyMacaw/wlogout)


#### Hyprland
Hyprland is not available from Void Linux‚Äôs official repositories [due to a conflict of packaging philosophy](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/issues/37544). However, a [third party repository](https://github.com/Makrennel/hyprland-void) is available with binary packages built in CI by GitHub Actions.

You can add this repository by creating a file such as `/etc/xbps.d/hyprland-void.conf` with the following contents:
```bash
echo "repository=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Makrennel/hyprland-void/repository-x86_64-glibc" > /etc/xbps.d/hyprland-void.conf

# Then update repo
xbps-install -S
```
Then you can install the packages as you would any other:
```
hyprland xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland hyprland-protocols hyprpaper hyprlock hypridle
```

#### Audio, Screen sharing & Media Player
**TL;DR** `pavucontrol` with `pipewire` framework and `mpv` for media player.<br>
More detailed information can be read at this [Void Linux Documentation: PipeWire](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/media/pipewire.html)
```
pavucontrol pipewire pipewire-devel alsa-pipewire wireplumber mpv
```

```bash
sudo mkdir -p 
sudo ln -s /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/50-pipewire.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d
sudo ln -s /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d
```
