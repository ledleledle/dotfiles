## About the Dotfiles
I started this project on December 2024 when I got laid off from my previous company. This project helped me fill the gap after getting laid off and continues my journey in **Ricing** Industry, which has been left untouched since 2020. Looking at my previous dotfiles makes me think, **God... What is this mess?** They're so disorganized and nearly impossible to reproduce. So, my comeback here is to create dotfiles with clean and simple code also easy to use.

This configuration is inspired by this cruel world, depression and anxious feeling. Please note that these configuration is simply what works for me and looks good to me, and they may not work for everyone, you have to adjust by yourself if some not work or *different taste* (lol) :laughing:. Feel free to use or adapt anything you find useful. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or problem.

**This configuration is:**
- :cry: Moody, can be dark or light.
- :keyboard: Keyboard users might love it but mouse-friendly too.
